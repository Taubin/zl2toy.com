        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;zl2toy&#34;&gt;ZL2TOY
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ZL2TOY is my father in laws former callsign. I was able to take a local &amp;ldquo;ham cram&amp;rdquo; class in 2020 at my local radio club, and to my relief I passed the exam, and was able to pick my callsign. A week or so later, I was informed I was assigned the callsign I had requested, and the rest as they say, is history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an American that is currently living in New Zealand as a permanent resident. Since getting licensed, my interest are mostly digital modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have a personal blog at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://taubin.cc/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://taubin.cc/&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ll be adding all of my new ham radio content here instead of there. You can also visit my &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.qrz.com/db/ZL2TOY&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;QRZ Page&lt;/a&gt;. I do my logging there as well as (begrudgingly) LOTW.&lt;/p&gt;
