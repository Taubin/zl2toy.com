## ZL2TOY

ZL2TOY is my father in laws former callsign. I was able to take a local "ham cram" class in 2020 at my local radio club, and to my relief I passed the exam, and was able to pick my callsign. A week or so later, I was informed I was assigned the callsign I had requested, and the rest as they say, is history.

I am an American that is currently living in New Zealand as a permanent resident. Since getting licensed, my interest are mostly digital modes.

I also have a personal blog at https://taubin.cc/ I'll be adding all of my new ham radio content here instead of there. You can also visit my [QRZ Page](https://www.qrz.com/db/ZL2TOY). I do my logging there as well as (begrudgingly) LOTW.
